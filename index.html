			<h1 class="WWWD w1">WHO</h1>
			<p class="W-a">The ENROOT & ENRICH CAMPAIGN is promoted by us, Project Semicolon, a non-profit organization dedicated to the prevention of suicide. Enroot & Enrich addresses the underlying causes of teen suicide by helping to provide teens and young adults with the opportunity for raising public awareness, educating youth, and equipping them with the proper tools in an all accepting environment. But even more than that, we give them a place to just be teens.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="cf"></div>

		<div class="info two">

			<h1 class="WWWD w2">WHAT</h1>

			<p class="W-a">We dream of building our own teen centers in 100+ LOCATIONS, around the United States. With these resources, we can provide teens with suicide, depression and bullying education, equipping them with the proper tools, and creating a community of saving lives.But that’s not the only reason.</p>

		<div class="equator">

			<p class="you-are">YOU ARE <u>ENOUGH</u></p>
			
		</div>

		<div class="cf-a"></div>

		<div class="info three">

			<h1 class="WWWD w3">WHY</h1>
			
			<p class="W-a">Funds to build these teen centers can help provide opportunities for teens in communities throughout the United States. They will have the chance to connect, be equipped with tools, and above all learn about suicide and bully prevention; building a family and community, TOGETHER saving lives.  These programs will stand to promote education, tools against causes of suicide for today’s youth, and the youth of the future, so suicide rates among all ages can be lowered, and true life-change can be made.</p>

		<div class="info four">

			<h1 class="WWWD wd">DONATE</h1>

			<p class="W-a">As a donor, you can ensure that when a teen needs support, Enroot & Enrich can provide it. Your contribution will help Enroot & Enrich better provide services that meet the needs of teens with mental health needs, survivors and their loved ones across the country, and allow us to plan education and advocacy efforts in our teen centers and in local communities.</p>
